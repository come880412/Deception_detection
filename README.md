# Deception detection
CVGIP2020:DECEPTION SYSTEM FOCUSING ON FACIAL EXPRESSION CHANGE WITH TONE OF VOICE(Award of best paper)\
ICSSE2020:Face Expression and Tone of Voice for Deception System(Award of best student paper)
# intro
There are four parts at our deception systemï¼š\
1.Emotion Unit\
2.Action Unit\
3.68 facial landmarks displacement\
4.Audio emotion feature\
We combine the above four features to do classification by SVM.And use this model to predict whether the subject is lie or not.
